**Join the Cyberhippie tribe!**

**Discover** Unique Digital Experiences
**Upgrade** Your Workspace To Us
**Support** Online & Local Indie Game Development Scene

https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8064/29358340823_9b5ce9cd3d_b.jpg

We are a **materialised need to grow and nurture unique interactive worlds**. As a small indie game studio and online network of game lovers and makers it serves as a united front for our passions.

We want to **deliver unique and surreal delights in interactive forms** and **enable people to express themselves through the digital medium** by providing a vibrant and homely workspace and event venue.

We're all about fostering community-based creativity & learning everything interactive.

The aim of this Patreon campaign is to **promote, establish and support** three projects that combine into what it will become thanks to you:
- an indie game studio,
- a collaborative workspace for game lovers and makers
- an event venue for gaming and creative workshops

**FAQ**

**What is the meaning behind your symbols?**

People have previously asked for some clarification on the meaning of icons we use and what they represent.

- Pinecone - its **purpose** is the one of a seed incubator; creative databank for making, learning and discovery.
- Branches - the **communal aspect**, represents the people who make it alive, a close-knit community, the tribe.
- Chair - the **spatial aspect**, a peaceful retreat for being focused or while collaborating with others.
- Laptop - the **technological aspect**, represents the creativity-enabling equipment available to our members.

All these elements together form the essence of Cyberhippie Collective.

**Indie Game Studio**

In order to provide financial stability for the studio and the community we are going to be selling our **games**, **digital products** and **merchandise** as well as providing **creative consulting**, **translation**, **marketing** and **VR tech rental**.

All funds received from you will be dedicated to enabling Cyberhippie to work unhindered by the economic nature of things. Your support will **aid production of interactive beauty for others to enjoy and enable a multitude of aspiring creators to learn and grow**. It's genuine passion and love that drives us!

**Workspace**

Our goal is to provide **a peaceful workspace experience for individuals and small teams**: fast Wi-Fi, inspiring game-themed space, comfy desks, plugs in strategic positions & access to vital hi-tech equipment. 

If you are looking for a safe haven to work on your project we will be there to provide it to you be it in physical location or online if you're a remote person. 

Big part of our idea is the presence of a **helpful community** providing **creative expertise** for our network and enabling disscusion on **the cultural development of indie games**. Free exchange of ideas is crucial for the growth of the medium.

**Event Venue**

Every month we will be hosting **in-house game-related events** both for the members of the tribe and people outside our immediate network of Cyberhippie Collective. 

Event types include **creative workshops, exhibits, training sessions, discussion panels, game jams, game nights** and **tournaments**. We will be livestreaming for remote members and the curious, you are covered.

There will also be a weekly <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/cyberhippiecollective">Weekend Retreat with Twitch</a> stream where all of us will be **searching for and enjoying the interactive gems of our times**. Join us in fun!

**What happens when I become your Patreon Supporter?**

If you choose to support us on a monthly basis through Patreon you gain multiple benefits based on the pledge tier chosen. Once we set up you will be getting:
- **our future indie games**, normally sold for a fair price
- **community workspace** and **Discord channel access**
- **free event tickets**
- dedicated **guidance for your creative project**
- Patron **credit on our website** or even **physically on the wall**
- **thank you note** & **our gratitude** for enabling something quirky but genuine

**What will my pledge go towards?**

Every space has its initial costs of setting up and after that an ongoing monthly cost. There are 2 phases:
- **Initial Push**: essential equipment, tables & chairs, first step towards inspiring decorations to make the community feel at home.
- **Monthly Cost**: space rental for the workspace, maintaining status of a startup, invested man & womanpower of our families and volunteers, internet, website hosting, organizing events & most importantly making games!

As soon as we reach a reasonable threshold we will leverage the funds gathered so far to boost the Initial Push and initiate the plan. We will rent a space and begin working on making it a place indie game scene truly deserves.

We are continuously raising awareness, ensuring that we maintain online presence (Tending To The Fireplace milestone and upwards) as well as the online community for remote users (through Discord). After the launch we will be gradually enhancing the space depending on the amount of funds you entrust us with both through our services and products as well as from your generous support. 

**Can I get access to my rewards immediately?**

Most of the rewards require having a running workspace. Rewards that don't will be fulfilled after 1st of the month. Once Securing The Camp milestone is reached it won't be long until you get all the benefits of being part of the tribe.

**Who is behind all this?**

So far Cyberhippie Collective is a one-man operation but we are constantly looking for helpers and supporters. Here is the roster so far:

https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/393/32619694031_1b8a92b0ea_b.jpg

@mothnode - A pi√±ata filled with oreos of indie game knowledge. Semi-nomadic creative explorer of traditional and emergent narration applied and used with technology in game design, photography, filmmaking, interactive installations and VR.

**I'd like to ask you more questions.**
Don't hesitate to contact us through whatever means necessary. We want to hear from you. You are the reason why we are here.

**Hope to see you soon at Cyberhippie Collective!**
