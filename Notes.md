Weekly Update (11th April 2016)

Hello my dearest tribe!
I'm happy to announce that today marks a new phase for Cyberhippie Collective project. I'm launching my Twitch stream for which I've been preparing for the past couple of weeks.
The setup is done (check out my previous post for a in-progress shot of my space) and we are good to go!
From here on out you'll be able to tune in to watch me talk to a pinecone microphone and play some interactive game gems.
Click here to join Cyberhippie Collective Twitch channel!
The proposed schedule is Monday to Thursday starting at noon GMT+1. The stream will usually last from to 2 to 6 hours depending on the amount of unforeseen errands I will have to attend to. Please bear with me as I adjust to the activity!
The first game I'm going to be streaming today and throughout the week is Black Desert - an open world MMO which has an unimaginable amount of things to do and discover. Can't tell you how excited I am to finally play this game!
Join the Twitch chat or talk to me via Twitter! I'll gladly answer all the questions!
See you soon!
Lots of hugs,
@mothnode

Weekly Update (4th April 2016)

Hello my bestest mensch and womensh! Thank you for bearing with me through the 'no update' times with such an unwavering loyalty and devotion. I've been trotting slowly but steadily ahead. The reason for my silence is pretty simple - I have fallen to a disease two times in the past two months. It's been quite an antibiotic ride but the good news is that I'm almost healed. I apologise for any delays it has caused.
That's the change of seasons for me. Goodbye winter, hello slightly warm and cuddly spring! Time for some good changes and a proper update!

Twitch Stream - Where Is My Tribe?

For the past month I've been assembling a project that I've been meaning to do for quite some time now. I present to you my Twitch stream where we'll be venturing out together in search for interactive beauty and streaming indie game gems as well as bigger games. It'll go live as soon as my PC arrives this week and I add some finishing touches to my interactive oasis.

Here is a shot of the progress!

I intend to start streaming next Monday on 11th April at noon CET and continue every week from Monday to Thursday. I might even be adding some bonus weekend streams if you'd like me to.

I've also created a place where you're able to have an impact on what games I'll be playing - you can check out the current list and cast your vote at my Twitch channel roadmap on Trello. You can read the FAQ and vote on stream upgrades as well. If you would like to request a game or just would like to talk to me, let me know on Twitter @mothnode, I will respond as soon as possible!

Initially, before I settle for my main Twitch game I'll be checking out a lot of titles. Since there's a lot coming out every month my list includes so far the likes of No Man's Sky, Black Desert Online, Hyper Light Drifter, Overwatch and Battleborn. Full list is available on my Trello roadmap linked above.

Game Development - Exploration Crawler

There is this game project I've been shuffling through in my head for a while. It's a pixel top-down exploration crawler. The best I could come up with in terms of a description so far goes as follows: think Hyper Light Drifter controls mixed with Sunless Sea exploration, achievement-seeking of Guild Wars 2 and the atmospheric journey of Below. How's that?

For the last month I've been doing small steps, making fonts for the game here, making some character, landscape & item sketches there, nothing concrete to show but the prototype will definitely be made in Construct 2. Let's see how this goes!

Thanks for tuning in for the Weekly Update of Cyberhippie Collective, have a wonderful beginning of spring and hope to see you soon in Twitch Chat!

Lots of hugs,

@mothnode

Weekly Update (18th April 2016)

Dearest people of the tribe,

My Cyberhippie Collective Twitch stream is going so good I can't contain my excitement! Doing this sort of activity full-time makes me feel what I haven't felt in years - a sense of accomplishment, the feeling of connecting to other people and actively exchanging opinions and ideas while having fun at the same time.
Over the course of last week we gained plenty of new viewers, played a lot of Black Desert with my freshly joined guild, invented a drinking game during the Bonus Friday Stream, checked out Battleborn as well as managed to get back into Guild Wars 2 and show you guys some of the game's features.
I would like to invite you to check it out via the links above and perhaps join in on the fun when we go live. See me talk to a pinecone!
Schedule is pretty simple: Monday to Thursday starting at noon GMT+1 with Black Desert Online + unscheduled bonus Weekend Retreat streams where I show off some interactive gems I used to or want to play.
Let me know what you think about it by talking to me on Twitter or check out my Trello board where you can vote on the games you think I should play, read my F.A.Q. and see the equipment I use.
See you on stream!
Lots of hugs,
@mothnode

Weekly Update (25th April 2016)

Dearest people of the tribe,

It's truly incredible that you decided to take a ride with me and join me on my quest to stream almost daily for almost 2 weeks straight now! I feel like I'm getting better and better at it and I have you to thank for it. You're basically battle-testing me for what's to come.
AWAY WE GO AKA FAMILY TIME

So here's the plan for this week:

I'm going on vacation with my lovely wife Mania and we're going to be attending 18th Cinema on the Border Festival, which takes place in Cieszyn, a lovely half Polish, half Czech town with a lot of charm and mysterious allure. We're going to be bathing in the oceans of alternative and unusual cinema; eating the famous Czech cheese smažák (a fried cheese battered in Czech triplecoat); communicating with the locals and generally resting before moving on into the rest of the year with twice the perseverance.

We'll be away from 27th April to 1st May and unfortunately there's going to be no stream in the next two days as well due to the preparation period - we have so much to do before we go! I hope you understand and share our enthusiasm!

THE JUICE OF WHAT'S TO COME

After I return there are going to be some changes as Overwatch is coming out soon after that and I would like to try something new in terms of the format of the stream. I'd like to introduce you to 2 new segments of the show (each focusing on different games) and reintroduce you to regular segment you already know for the sake of consistency:

Relaxing Black Desert (from 2nd May onwards) - Black Desert Online continues to be our main game for now as it perfectly encompasses the feelings and the vibe I'm looking to share with you - peace, beauty and relaxing not-so-endless grind accompanied with soothing music, incredible exploratory adventures and zen combat.
Heroes Shooting Heroes (from 5th May onwards) - Overwatch stream with lots of levelling and having fun chuckling at the overly ridiculous graphical style of the game. Maybe trolling ourselves and getting into the meta-meta game of the game.
Logmaster (from 21st June onwards) - No Man's Sky Journal Log presenting the perils and the beauty of procedurally-generated infinite space tales. I'm going to be taking on a character of a lone traveller trying to reach the centre of the galaxy and discover its mysteries!
I'm also figuring out how to tie in my love for Guild Wars 2 into all this but I guess it will just come out on its own along the way - perhaps it will be our Weekend Retreat game. I do promise we're going to be playing some indie game gems along the way as well, so no worries!

COMMUNITY IN PROGRESS

I'd like to take this opportunity to say thank you for participating in this wonderful journey with me through the multitude of digital worlds! I'm honoured you feel like I'm worthy of your attention and I hope I can maintain that state for us by doing what we love together!

Hence, to those that are still on the edge, I invite you to check out my stream right here and perhaps join in on the fun when we go live. See me talk to a pinecone!

Let me know what you think about my project on Twitter or check out my Trello board where you can vote on games you think I should play, read my F.A.Q. and see the equipment I use.

See you on stream & have a great day!

Lots of hugs,

@mothnode

What you can do: Pick a date, create an expiring incentive, and let them get excited with you.
What you can do: Beat post paralysis by getting the word out everywhere and as often as possible.
What you can do: Ditch the captions and put clear, concise calls-to-action directly on the image.
What you can do: Remember to pause and celebrate the wins with your community, whether it’s through a
tweet that takes 10 seconds or a dance that takes little to no choreography.
Make the cheap rewards the best rewards: “Set up rewards in lower tiers that would be really exciting to
people.” While a $100 pledge is always welcome, Nataly knows that most fans are likely to choose the
lower reward tiers, so those should be widely attractive to the majority. Also vital to note, “since so many
people pledge at the lower tiers, it’s important to make sure those perks don’t take too much of your time to
fulfill or disrupt your workflow.”
Let them put their name on it: Nataly dug into the old-school patronage playbook for a reward that was too
enticing for fans to say no to: all patrons pledging before August 15th would get their name on the physical
album.
